# Title Understanding Regex: Breaking Down an Email Validation Pattern

Welcome to this tutorial! As a web development student, understanding how to use regular expressions (regex) is essential for various tasks, such as validating user input. In this tutorial, we'll break down a common regex pattern used for email validation. By the end, you'll have a solid grasp of how each component of the regex works to match valid email addresses.

## Summary

This tutorial focuses on the following regex pattern, commonly used for email validation:
/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/

We'll dissect each part of this pattern to understand how it works, ensuring you can confidently apply similar patterns in your projects.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to assert the position within a string. In the email regex pattern:

`^`: Asserts the position at the start of a string.
`$`: Asserts the position at the end of a string.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should appear:

`+`: Matches one or more of the preceding element. For example, [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+ ensures that the username part of the email has at least one valid character.

### OR Operator

The OR operator is used to match one of several patterns. However, this particular regex does not use the OR operator (`|`), but in other regex patterns, it could be used to allow multiple alternatives.

### Character Classes

Character classes are used to define a set of characters to match:

`[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]`: Matches any uppercase or lowercase letter, any digit, or one of the special characters `.`, `_`, `%`, `+`, `-`.

### Flags

Flags modify the behavior of the regex, but this pattern does not use any flags. Some common flags include:

`i`: Case-insensitive matching.
`g`: Global matching (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match).
`m`: Multiline matching.

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
